Das U-Boot is world's must used bootloader manager in embedded systems. It's supports various architetures including arm that we uses in our project.

To compile the u-boot source for the mini2440 target, you must download the openmoko u-boot's version with: git clone git://repo.or.cz/u-boot-openmoko/mini2440.git.

Or you can use the source in this folder.

The steps to compile the u-boot for mini2440 are:

host@user:~/Project$ tar -xvf u-boot_openmoko.tar.gz
host@user:~/Project$ cd u-boot/
host@user:~/Project/u-boot$ make mini2440_config
host@user:~/Project/u-boot$ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-


Now you have the u-boot image (u-boot.bin) to use in your target.
